## [3.0.1] - 2024-09-07
### Fixed
* #1491 Fix migration error when there are pre-existing Access Tokens.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-09-05

### WARNING - POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES
* Changes to the `AbstractAccessToken` model require doing a `manage.py migrate` after upgrading.
* If you use swappable models you will need to make sure your custom models are also updated (usually `manage.py makemigrations`).
* Old Django versions below 4.2 are no longer supported.
* A few deprecations warned about in 2.4.0 (#1345) have been removed. See below.

### Added
* #1366 Add Docker containerized apps for testing IDP and RP.
* #1454 Added compatibility with `LoginRequiredMiddleware` introduced in Django 5.1.

### Changed
* Many documentation and project internals improvements.
* #1446 Use generic models `pk` instead of `id`. This enables, for example, custom swapped models to have a different primary key field.
* #1447 Update token to TextField from CharField. Removing the 255 character limit enables supporting JWT tokens with additional claims.
  This adds a SHA-256 `token_checksum` field that is used to validate tokens.
* #1450 Transactions wrapping writes of the Tokens now rely on Django's database routers to determine the correct
  database to use instead of assuming that 'default' is the correct one.
* #1455 Changed minimum supported Django version to >=4.2.

### Removed
* #1425 Remove deprecated `RedirectURIValidator`, `WildcardSet` per #1345; `validate_logout_request` per #1274

### Fixed
* #1444, #1476 Fix several 500 errors to instead raise appropriate errors.
* #1469 Fix `ui_locales` request parameter triggers `AttributeError` under certain circumstances

### Security
* #1452 Add a new setting [`REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_PROTECTION`](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#refresh-token-reuse-protection).
  In combination with [`ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKEN`](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#rotate-refresh-token),
  this prevents refresh tokens from being used more than once. See more at
  [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-29#name-recommendations)
* #1481 Bump oauthlib version required to 3.2.2 and above to address [CVE-2022-36087](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3pgj-pg6c-r5p7).

## [2.4.0] - 2024-05-13

### WARNING
Issues caused by **Release 2.0.0 breaking changes** continue to be logged. Please **make sure to carefully read these release notes** before
performing a MAJOR upgrade to 2.x.

These issues both result in `{"error": "invalid_client"}`:

1. The application client secret is now hashed upon save. You must copy it before it is saved. Using the hashed value will fail.

2. `PKCE_REQUIRED` is now `True` by default. You should use PKCE with your client or set `PKCE_REQUIRED=False` if you are unable to fix the client.

If you are going to revert migration 0006 make note that previously hashed client_secret cannot be reverted!

### Added
* #1304 Add `OAuth2ExtraTokenMiddleware` for adding access token to request.
  See [Setup a provider](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial_03.html#setup-a-provider) in the Tutorial.
* #1273 Performance improvement: Add caching of loading of OIDC private key.
* #1285 Add `post_logout_redirect_uris` field in the [Application Registration form](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates.html#application-registration-form-html)
* #1311,#1334 (**Security**) Add option to disable client_secret hashing to allow verifying JWTs' signatures when using
  [HS256 keys](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oidc.html#using-hs256-keys).
  This means your client secret will be stored in cleartext but is the only way to successfully use HS256 signed JWT's.
* #1350 Support Python 3.12 and Django 5.0
* #1367 Add `code_challenge_methods_supported` property to auto discovery information, per [RFC 8414 section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html#page-7)
* #1328 Adds the ability to [define how to store a user profile](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oidc.html#define-where-to-store-the-profile).

### Fixed
* #1292 Interpret `EXP` in AccessToken always as UTC instead of (possibly) local timezone.
  Use setting `AUTHENTICATION_SERVER_EXP_TIME_ZONE` to enable different time zone in case the remote
  authentication server does not provide EXP in UTC.
* #1323 Fix instructions in [documentation](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#authorization-code)
  on how to create a code challenge and code verifier
* #1284 Fix a 500 error when trying to logout with no id_token_hint even if the browser session already expired.
* #1296 Added reverse function in migration `0006_alter_application_client_secret`. Note that reversing this migration cannot undo a hashed `client_secret`.
* #1345 Fix encapsulation for Redirect URI scheme validation. Deprecates `RedirectURIValidator` in favor of `AllowedURIValidator`.
* #1357 Move import of setting_changed signal from test to django core modules.
* #1361 Fix prompt=none redirects to login screen
* #1380 Fix AttributeError in OAuth2ExtraTokenMiddleware when a custom AccessToken model is used.
* #1288 Fix #1276 which attempted to resolve #1092 for requests that don't have a client_secret per [RFC 6749 4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.1.1)
* #1337 Gracefully handle expired or deleted refresh tokens, in `validate_user`.
* Various documentation improvements: #1410, #1408, #1405, #1399, #1401, #1396, #1375, #1162, #1315, #1307

### Removed
* #1350 Remove support for Python 3.7 and Django 2.2

## [2.3.0] 2023-05-31

## [2.0.0] 2022-04-24

This is a major release with **BREAKING** changes. Please make sure to review these changes before upgrading:

### Added
* #1106 OIDC: Add "scopes_supported" to the [ConnectDiscoveryInfoView](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oidc.html#connectdiscoveryinfoview).
  This completes the view to provide all the REQUIRED and RECOMMENDED [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).
* #1128 Documentation: [Tutorial](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial_05.html)
  on using Celery to automate clearing expired tokens.

### Changed
* #1129 (**Breaking**) Changed default value of PKCE_REQUIRED to True. This is a **breaking change**. Clients without
  PKCE enabled will fail to authenticate. This breaks with [section 5 of RFC7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)
  in favor of the [OAuth2 Security Best Practices for Authorization Code Grants](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#section-2.1).
  If you want to retain the pre-2.x behavior, set `PKCE_REQUIRED = False` in your settings.py
* #1093 (**Breaking**) Changed to implement [hashed](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/passwords/)
  client_secret values. This is a **breaking change** that will migrate all your existing
  cleartext `application.client_secret` values to be hashed with Django's default password hashing algorithm
  and can not be reversed. When adding or modifying an Application in the Admin console, you must copy the
  auto-generated or manually-entered `client_secret` before hitting Save.
* #1108 OIDC: (**Breaking**) Add default configurable OIDC standard scopes that determine which claims are returned.
  If you've [customized OIDC responses](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oidc.html#customizing-the-oidc-responses)
  and want to retain the pre-2.x behavior, set `oidc_claim_scope = None` in your subclass of `OAuth2Validator`.
* #1108 OIDC: Make the `access_token` available to `get_oidc_claims` when called from `get_userinfo_claims`.
* #1132: Added `--algorithm` argument to `createapplication` management command

### Fixed
* #1108 OIDC: Fix `validate_bearer_token()` to properly set `request.scopes` to the list of granted scopes.
* #1132: Fixed help text for `--skip-authorization` argument of the `createapplication` management command.

### Removed
* #1124 (**Breaking**, **Security**) Removes support for insecure `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` and `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto` which are replaced
  by [RFC 8252](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252) "OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps" BCP. Google has
  [deprecated use of oob](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html?m=1#disallowed-oob) with
  a final end date of 2022-10-03. If you still rely on oob support in django-oauth-toolkit, do not upgrade to this release.

## [1.7.1] 2022-03-19

### Removed
* #1126 Reverts #1070 which incorrectly added Celery auto-discovery tasks.py (as described in #1123) and because it conflicts
  with Huey's auto-discovery which also uses tasks.py as described in #1114. If you are using Celery or Huey, you'll need
  to separately implement these tasks.

## [1.7.0] 2022-01-23

### Added
* #969 Add batching of expired token deletions in `cleartokens` management command and `models.clear_expired()`
  to improve performance for removal of large numbers of expired tokens. Configure with
  [`CLEAR_EXPIRED_TOKENS_BATCH_SIZE`](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#clear-expired-tokens-batch-size) and
  [`CLEAR_EXPIRED_TOKENS_BATCH_INTERVAL`](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#clear-expired-tokens-batch-interval).
* #1070 Add a Celery task for clearing expired tokens, e.g. to be scheduled as a [periodic task](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html).
* #1062 Add Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translations.
* #1069 OIDC: Add an alternate form of
  [get_additional_claims()](https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oidc.html#adding-claims-to-the-id-token)
  which makes the list of additional `claims_supported` available at the OIDC auto-discovery endpoint (`.well-known/openid-configuration`).

### Fixed
* #1012 Return 200 status code with `{"active": false}` when introspecting a nonexistent token
  per [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.2). It had been incorrectly returning 401.

## [1.6.3] 2022-01-11

### Fixed
* #1085 Fix for #1083 admin UI search for idtoken results in `django.core.exceptions.FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'token' into field.`

### Added
* #1085 Add admin UI search fields for additional models.

## [1.6.2] 2022-01-06

**NOTE: This release reverts an inadvertently-added breaking change.**

### Fixed

* #1056 Add missing migration triggered by [Django 4.0 changes to the migrations autodetector](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/releases/4.0/#migrations-autodetector-changes).
* #1068 Revert #967 which incorrectly changed an API. See #1066.

## [1.6.1] 2021-12-23

### Changed
* Note: Only Django 4.0.1+ is supported due to a regression in Django 4.0.0. [Explanation](https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/pull/1046#issuecomment-998015272)

* Fix a crash with malformed IPv6 redirect URIs

## 1.1.1 [2018-05-08]

* **Critical**: Django OAuth Toolkit 1.1.0 contained a migration that would revoke all existing
  RefreshTokens (`0006_auto_20171214_2232`). This release corrects the migration.
  If you have already ran it in production, please see the following issue for more details:
  https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/issues/589
