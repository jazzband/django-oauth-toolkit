Welcome to Django OAuth Toolkit Documentation
=============================================

Django OAuth Toolkit can help you by providing, out of the box, all the endpoints, data, and logic needed to add OAuth2
capabilities to your Django projects. Django OAuth Toolkit makes extensive use of the excellent
`OAuthLib <https://github.com/idan/oauthlib>`_, so that everything is
`rfc-compliant <https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html>`_.

See our :doc:`Changelog <changelog>` for information on updates.
