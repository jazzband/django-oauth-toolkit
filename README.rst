If you are facing one or more of the following:
 * Your Django app exposes a web API you want to protect with OAuth2 authentication,
 * You need to implement an OAuth2 authorization server to provide tokens management for your infrastructure,

Django OAuth Toolkit can help you providing out of the box all the endpoints, data and logic needed to add OAuth2
capabilities to your Django projects. Django OAuth Toolkit makes extensive use of the excellent
`OAuthLib <https://github.com/idan/oauthlib>`_, so that everything is
`rfc-compliant <https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html>`_.

How you can help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See our
`contributing <https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`__
info and the open
`issues <https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/issues>`__ and

~~~~~~~~~~~
Have questions or want to discuss the project?
See `the discussions <https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/discussions>`__.


Submit PRs and Perform Reviews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PR submissions and reviews are always appreciated! Since we require an
independent review of any PR before it can be merged, having your second
set of eyes looking at PRs is extremely valuable.

Please don’t merge PRs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please be aware that we don’t want *every* Jazzband member to merge PRs
but just a handful of project team members so that we can maintain a
modicum of control over what goes into a release of this security oriented code base. Only `project
leads <https://jazzband.co/projects/django-oauth-toolkit>`__ are able to
publish releases to Pypi and it becomes difficult when creating a new
release for the leads to deal with “unexpected” merged PRs.

Become a Project Lead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are interested in stepping up to be a Project Lead, please take a look at
the `discussion about this <https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit/discussions/1479>`__.
